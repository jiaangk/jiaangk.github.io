Hi, I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).
I entered the university in 2018 from [Honors Youth Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young) when I graduated from junior high school.
After 2 years preparatory phase, I started my undergraduate career.
I joined the AISEC group in Nov. 2023 as a research intern student, advised by [Prof. Zhengyu Zhao](https://zhengyuzhao.github.io/).
I am also an intern student remotely advised by [Prof. Xiao Zhang](https://xiao-zhang.net/) from [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en).

**I am looking for Ph.D. positions in Security and Machine Learning starting in 25Fall!**
